This document is part of the ["Computing Advice for Students"][computing] series. It is a prequel to ["10 Computing Tips and Tricks for Students"][ct1-pdf] and ["10 Additional Computing Tips and Tricks for Students"][ct2-pdf], and contains a few recommendations that are not repeated in those two documents.

## Part 1: Computing

### 1. Keeping track of university

- Use some form of __agenda__ or calendar application.
- Bookmark your __university portals__ and important pages.
- Use a __specific, secure browser session__ for university-related work.
- Use a __specific user folder__ to store study material.

___Note___ -- Other documents in this series will come back to Web browsers at several points.

### 2. Writing proper emails

- Use a __proper email address__, not a pseudonym.
- Set up your email to show your __full name__ as the sender.
- Use __email filters__ to stay on top of your inbox.
- Use a __sensible email signature__.

___Note___ -- Politeness and correct language are not computing requirements, just standard requirements of communication between human beings.

### 3. Downloading and archiving

- Learn to use your __browser bookmarks__.
- Learn how to __print to PDF__ format on your system.
- Learn to use [Perma.cc][perma.cc] and [Save It Offline][save-it-offline] to save Web pages and videos.
- If you are tech-savvy, also learn about [wget][wget], [jDownloader][jdownloader] and [youtube-dl][youtube-dl].

Most importantly, ___stay organised___ -- rename files to sensible names, and keep folder hierarchies to the simplest scheme that you can come up with.

### 4. Keeping one's laptop fast enough

Read __["10 Ways to Make A Computer Painfully Slow and Unusable"][slow-pdf]__ after you are done reading the main documents of this series.

### 5. Saving laptop battery life

To spare your laptop battery:

- Close your __Internet__ (Wi-Fi) connexion.
- Close memory- and/or CPU-__intensive programs__.
- Lower your __screen brightness__ to 50%.
- Read the material for Tip #4 (see below).

Memory- and/or CPU-intensive programs are covered in the [document][slow-pdf] linked to in the previous tip. One if its recommendations that applies here is to use a plain text editor instead of a word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word) to take notes in class.

## Part 2: Research

### 6. Searching for academic material

- Learn to use __[Google Scholar][google-scholar]__ and other academic search engines.
- Use your __course readings__, including 'additional' ones from bibliographies.
- Use your __university library__ to its full extent.
- Learn about __academic journals__, and get familiar with a few of them.

___Important___ – Academic integrity requires that you will be able to cite, and possibly provide, your sources, so save them and do not 'copy-paste' material without making a proper citation to the source.

### 7. Citing and formatting references

- Take a look at the __citations__ in your course readings.
- Take a look at the __references__ listed at the end of your course readings.
- Learn about the __[Harvard 'author-year' bibliographic style][harvard]__.
- Consider using a __reference management__ program like [Zotero][zotero] or [Mendeley][mendeley].

___Important___ – remember the academic penalties for plagiarism, including 'not knowing how to cite properly' and self-plagiarism.

### 8. Finding saved material

- Did I already tell you about __naming your files__ properly?
- Did I already tell you about __organising your folders__ as simply as possible?
- Learn to use __quick search__ (e.g. [Spotlight][spotlight] on Mac)
- Learn to __search by creation/modification date__ or by file format

Tip #3 of ["10 Computing Tips and Tricks for Students"][ct1-pdf] will tell you about 'launcher' programs that vastly improve searching for disk files or looking for information online.

### 9. Evading uninteresting material

- Haven't your read enough __clickbait__ in your life already?
- Do you _really_ need to read that many __media 'articles'__ (i.e. badly rewritten press releases) a day?
- Do you gain anything from spending 2+ hours per day on __social media__?
- Are you watching __online videos__ like old people used to watch soap operas on TV?

Last, are you sure that the last course reading that you decided to skip is as uninteresting as you think it is? Are you not at university specifically to learn to read – and, in a few years, to write – complex, long arguments written in some form of 'technical' language?

### 10. Finding interesting material

- Your teachers do their best to pack __course syllabuses__ with interesting material.
- Try a few __'long-form' publications__ like _[Le Monde diplomatique][monde-diplo]_ and the _[The Atlantic][the-atlantic]_.
- __[Youtube][youtube]__ is a great resource once you start looking for proper conferences and talks.
- __Blogs__ (and among them, scientific blogs) are often cosy and fun.
